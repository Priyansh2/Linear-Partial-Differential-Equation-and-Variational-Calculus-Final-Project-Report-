**Problem Statement**

Using spherical polar co-ordinates (𝑟, 𝜃,𝜙) defined by 𝑥 = 𝑟 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜙, 𝑦 = 𝑟 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜙, 𝑧 = 𝑟 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃, write down the explicit Lagrange’s equation of motion for a particle of mass m 
moving in a central potential 𝑉(𝑟). Further take 𝑉(𝑟) =𝑘/r and describe the nature of the equation of motion and propose a way to solve that equation of motion.
